# Map-based Lidar-camera Calibration Tool

The software is an HD vector map based LiDAR-camera calibration tool, which could be used to calibrate non-overlapping LiDAR-camera pairs with little manually labeled correspondences, and inspect the quality of calibration results.

The important features of the calibration tool:  
* LiDAR-camera calibration and inspection with HD vector map as the calibration field
* Recommend optimal selections of line-line 3d-2d correspondences and quick labeling
* Navigate between images with vector map reprojections and correspondences in a sequence

**Note: The whole project will be uploaded progressively in 2 weeks**
